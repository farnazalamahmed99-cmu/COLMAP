**Computer Vision Research: 3D Reconstruction from Aerial Imagery**

Led the development of a complete photogrammetric reconstruction pipeline for the ULTRRA 2025 (Urban Landscape Tracking and Reconstruction for Reality Applications) benchmark, a competitive challenge presented at WACV 2025 focusing on camera calibration and novel view synthesis from drone imagery.

**🔬 Project Overview:**
The ULTRRA challenge presents real-world complexities in 3D reconstruction: varying image densities, mixed camera models, large geographic areas, and altitude variations. My solution processes raw aerial photographs and produces calibrated camera poses, sparse point clouds, dense reconstructions, and textured 3D meshes.

**⚙️ Technical Implementation:**

*Structure-from-Motion (SfM) Pipeline:*
- Implemented SIFT-based feature extraction across hundreds of images
- Developed exhaustive and sequential feature matching strategies
- Built incremental sparse reconstruction with bundle adjustment optimization
- Exported camera intrinsics/extrinsics in multiple formats (COLMAP, NVM, TXT)

*Dense Reconstruction & Meshing:*
- Integrated OpenMVS for multi-view stereo dense point cloud generation
- Implemented depth map estimation and fusion algorithms
- Generated watertight 3D meshes with Delaunay triangulation
- Produced textured models for visualization and downstream applications

*Pipeline Automation:*
- Created PowerShell scripts for batch processing multiple datasets
- Built modular workflow supporting parallel task execution
- Implemented progress tracking and error handling

**📊 Datasets Processed:**
| Challenge | Images | Focus Area |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Task 01 | 79 | Image Density |
| Task 02 | 64 | Camera Models |
| Task 03 | 340 | Large Area Coverage |
| Task 04 | 72 | Altitude Variation |

**🛠️ Technologies & Tools:**
- **Core:** COLMAP, OpenMVS, OpenCV
- **Languages:** C++, PowerShell, Python
- **Build Systems:** CMake, vcpkg
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

**💡 Skills Demonstrated:**
- Multi-view geometry and epipolar constraints
- Camera calibration (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters)
- Bundle adjustment optimization
- Point cloud processing and mesh generation
- Large-scale data pipeline development

**🎯 Applications:**
This work directly applies to autonomous vehicles (localization/mapping), augmented reality (scene understanding), urban planning (digital twins), and robotics (SLAM systems).
